A fansite for players of the MMO Vindictus can come to learn tips and tricks and find communities of people to play the game with.


## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React/Javascript/TailwindCSS

## Optimizations

This is a work in progress and my first sizeable web application so there will be many updates and optimizations to come soon.

## Lessons Learned:

What I have learned from building this application is how to properly utilize and manage React state variables using the useState hook. 
I have also learned many useful CSS properties to make design easier including using TailwindCSS for easy styling.
